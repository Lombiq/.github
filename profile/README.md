## Open-source and open hearts
Apart from the software world we also try to help in other communities with our philanthropic activities. Most recently, we've delivered thousands of reusable masks to the Hungarian Charity Service of the Order of Malta during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as help for refugees of the war in Ukraine, and again.
